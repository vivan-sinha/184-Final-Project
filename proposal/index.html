		<h1>Paint by Numbers, Coloring Book Sim</h1>
		<h4 style = "text-align: center;">By Keira Swei, Vivan Sinha, Robert Ni, and Kyle Cheng</h4>

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>Given an input image, the program will turn it into a 
			paint-by-numbers, where each color is labeled with a number 
			(like a coloring book). A UI will enable the user to color the 
			image using colored brush strokes and perhaps other art methods 
			like pointillism. Brush strokes should look realistic as if an 
			actual paintbrush, pencil, etc., was used.
		</p>

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		<p>Problem: It can be challenging to replicate details, select 
			a color palette, or apply an artistic style when painting 
			with an image reference.</p>
		<p>Solution: Our project aims to create a paint-by-numbers 
			representation from an inputted image. This application 
			would make painting by numbers completely customizable and 
			accessible. Additionally, this project would be a great 
			learning opportunity for all of us as we figure out how to 
			segment the images, constrain color palettes, and create 
			realistic brush strokes. We are interested in investigating 
			the Kuwahara filter to potentially reduce noise in the 
			images or create a painting-like effect, as well as image 
			thresholding or edge detection algorithms to segment the image.</p>

		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
		<p>The project has 3 steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The user should be able to select an image from 
				their file system and upload it. The program 
				will display this image.
			</li>
			<li>
				Convert to paint-by-numbers. Through this project, 
				we hope to create an interactive system where a user 
				can transform an image of their choosing into a 
				paint-by-numbers coloring interface. 
				In order to achieve this, we plan to design an 
				algorithm that divides an image into several areas of 
				similar enough color, find a way to average the colors 
				in a given area or partition the colors in the image 
				into set buckets of color, and create a system to 
				allow users to choose colors and fill in blocks of color.
			</li>
			<li>
				Paint. The program will attempt to paint brush strokes 
				with the corresponding color in each numbered section. 
				The brush strokes will look realistic, like real brush 
				strokes. Multiple brush strokes and different directions 
				make the painting more realistic.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Our ultimate goal and the final result would be a working 
			interface itself, where a user would upload an image, 
			generate a paint-by-numbers page, and be able to color in 
			the paint-by-numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			We plan to achieve these goals by extending concepts we used
			 in class (particularly Homework 1), where we learned to draw 
			 and sample triangles to render an image. We plan on using a 
			 Kuwahara filter to block out colors first and then create a 
			 more paint-like image. Then, we will research and utilize edge 
			 detection methods that help divide an image into sections of 
			 different colors and average these colors. The last step 
			 would be to take the images and edges and transfer them 
			 into a working interface that allows a user to fill in 
			 blocks of the image. These goals are achievable because of 
			 the wide range of resources available to perform edge detection 
			 and color extraction/grouping tasks.
		</p>

		<p>In order to measure the quality of the system, we will use 
			online generators that perform similar tasks as a benchmark 
			for our own paint-by-numbers generator. This would give us 
			some reference for what a paint-by-numbers should look like 
			for an image. Additionally, we will perform many tests on 
			our own to document our experiences using our UI and confirm 
			that our interface works well.
		</p>

		<p><b>What we plan to deliver:</b> We plan to deliver a program 
			that can take any image as input and convert it into a 
			paint-by-numbers template. We also plan for this 
			template to be interactive with a UI so the user can 
			fill in the template in a simulated painting environment.
		</p>
		<p><b>What we hope to deliver:</b> If we are ahead of schedule, 
			we can implement more art styles, including a 3D aspect 
			to the simulation to allow light reflection off 
			brushstrokes or auto-painting of the template.
		</p>

		<h2>Schedule</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Week 1: Paint by number image conversion</li>
			<li>Week 2: Painting algorithms and realistic brush strokes</li>
			<li>Week 3: Adjust/fix the image conversion and painting algorithms from the previous weeks</li>
			<li>Week 4: Create the UI to paint onto the image</li>
			<li>Extra: Maybe add a 3d viewer to show the depth of brushstrokes</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The application will potentially be written in Python and maybe 
				JavaScript. The program might be able to run on the web if it's 
				light enough (but the 3d viewer might require more).</li>
			<li>Kuwahara filter</li>
			<li>Image Thresholding</li>
			<li>Edge Detection</li>
			<li>Reducing the number of colors in an image: <a href = "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800064.801294">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800064.801294</a></li>
